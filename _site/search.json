    "text": "Proposal\nThe benefits for academics to apply open data practices to their work are well-researched and understood but need to be clarified for professionals working at the policy, implementation or evaluation components (McKiernan et al. 2016). Few in the WASH sector know of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Inoperable, Reusable) data sharing principles or understand the benefits of open file formats, machine-readability or machine-actionable metadata (Wilkinson et al. 2016). Unprocessed (raw) data is rarely shared, and even processed data is often stuck in proprietary spreadsheet-based and word-processing software or, worse, in PDFs. Unpublished (or published not following FAIR principles) data remains inaccessible to other researchers who could explore new analysis methods. As a result, collaboration is stifled, resources are wasted, and the wheel is constantly reinvented at an extensive cost to donors and project beneficiaries (GSMA 2021).\nThe “Data Science for WASH” workshop hosted at the Colorado WASH Symposium 2021 focused on data analysis aspects. This workshop focuses on data management aspects with hands-on practical experience using Posit Cloud for interactive live coding and GitHub for data publication. Participants will get to discuss and share their data management experiences in break-out sessions where outputs are captured using a digital whiteboard solution (e.g. Padlet). The event will be hosted remotely using Zoom, with requirements for participation being an internet connection, a browser, an account on GitHub, an ORCID iD, and a willingness to learn.\nWe offer participants the opportunity to learn about a community effort that may positively impact how we collaborate in the WASH sector. The community-building process relies on active engagement, and members can shape and contribute to it during the session and beyond. Active participation is possible without costly software, managed infrastructure, or physical travel. We provided the computing environment, which is based on open-source and free software (R and RStudio IDE). The entire process of sharing WASH data openly ensures that those who have contributed to collecting and publishing data also receive appropriate credit, which currently isn’t the case. Lastly, the community and this workshop have a Code of Conduct that supports a harassment-free experience for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGSMA. 2021. “Innovative Data for Urban Planning: The Opportunities and Challenges of Public-Private Data Partnerships.” Mobile for Development. https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/resources/innovative-data-for-urban-planning-the-opportunities-and-challenges-of-public-private-data-partnerships/.\n\n\nMcKiernan, Erin C, Philip E Bourne, C Titus Brown, Stuart Buck, Amye Kenall, Jennifer Lin, Damon McDougall, et al. 2016. “How Open Science Helps Researchers Succeed.” Edited by Peter Rodgers. eLife 5 (July): e16800. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16800.\n\n\nWilkinson, Mark D., Michel Dumontier, IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg, Gabrielle Appleton, Myles Axton, Arie Baak, Niklas Blomberg, et al. 2016. “The FAIR Guiding Principles for Scientific Data Management and Stewardship.” Scientific Data 3 (1): 160018. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18."
